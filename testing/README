Scripts for reproducing tests from Hague et al. 2018
====================================================

Run the "prep" scripts as standalone python programs, and then the "run" scripts from inside CASA.
The VLA test is generated by a single script to be run through CASA


In this folder
==============

  NGC1808_cont.dirty5.fits - A sample fits file reprocessed from a public ALMA archive project;
                             only used to provide a header for the prep scripts

  simprep_diff.py - Produces the sky models for the test shown in Fig. 4 
  simprep.py - Produces the sky models for the test shown in Fig. 3
  snprep.py - Produces the sky models for the test shown in Table 2

  simrun_diff.py - Produces the dirty maps for the test shown in Fig. 4
  simrun.py - Produces the CLEAN and dirty maps for the test shown in Fig. 3
  simrun_sn.py - Produces the dirty maps for the test shown in Table 2

  simvla.py - Produces the dirty maps for the test shown in Fig. 5


Applying BaSC
=============

All of the tests were run with the default parameters, plus
Iseed = 54321
Ensemble = 20
Rate = 0.1

The noise level for the ALMA based tests was set to 0.00056, and for the VLA tess 0.005

give whatever help I can, time permitting.
